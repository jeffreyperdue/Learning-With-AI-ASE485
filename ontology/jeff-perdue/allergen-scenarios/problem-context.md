# Problem Context

### Conceptual framing for why allergen ambiguity emerges in minimalist menus

Many restaurant menus rely on minimal language to communicate confidence and craft. In doing so, they assume a shared understanding between the kitchen and the diner. When allergen-related distinctions are embedded in this implicit understanding rather than made explicit, ambiguity can emerge, even when no one intends it.

The core obstacle is that allergen-relevant distinctions must compete with aesthetic minimalism, leaving little room for explicit clarification.

When menus are designed to be visually restrained, clarity is often communicated through absence rather than presence.
