# Allergen Ambiguity Scenario #3

**A single menu item:** Sesame Crusted Tuna – braised baby bok choy / wasabi mashed / Mongolian pepper sauce

Taken directly from [McCormick & Schmick's](https://www.mccormickandschmicks.com/location/mccormick-schmicks-cincinnati-oh/?_gl=1*1a9zxnk*_gcl_au*MzQyOTU4MDEuMTc3MDEzNjMxOQ..*_ga*MTA0NTE1OTQ1OC4xNzcwMTM2MzE5*_ga_RW3BK68HCE*czE3NzAxMzYzMTkkbzEkZzEkdDE3NzAxMzYzMjkkajUwJGwwJGgw#menus) on 2.3.26

A menu lists Sesame Crusted Tuna, described as braised baby bok choy, wasabi mashed, Mongolian pepper sauce. The dish name explicitly references sesame, and the menu includes a general disclaimer stating that "Not all ingredients are listed, please advise your server if you have any allergy concerns." No item-level allergen indicators or clarifying language are provided.

## Entities Involved

### Core Food-Related Entities

- **Menu Item**
  - Sesame Crusted Tuna

- **Ingredient**
  - Tuna
  - Sesame
  - Baby bok choy
  - Wasabi mashed (potatoes assumed)
  - Mongolian pepper sauce

- **Allergen**
  - Sesame
  - Fish

### Representation and Communication Entities

- **Menu Description**
  - Short ingredient-style listing paired with a descriptive dish name

- **Allergen Disclosure**
  - The term "sesame" appears in the dish name

- **Disclaimer**
  - Global allergen statement applied to the entire menu rather than the individual item

### Contextual and Environmental Entities

- **Preparation Method**
  - "Crusted" (extent, thickness, removability, and composition unspecified)

- **Kitchen Environment**
  - Shared equipment and preparation surfaces

- **Restaurant**
  - Party responsible for preparation and communication

- **Consumer**
  - A diner with a sesame allergy

- **Allergic Condition**
  - Sensitivity ranging from mild to severe sesame allergy

## Assumptions Being Made

### By the Restaurant

- The presence of "sesame" in the dish name sufficiently signals allergen presence
- The general disclaimer adequately addresses allergen concerns
- Diners will ask servers for clarification if needed
- No additional clarification is required at the item level
- The role of sesame (seed, oil, crust, seasoning) does not need to be specified

### By the Consumer

- Sesame is present in a predictable or familiar form
- Sesame is limited to the crust and not used elsewhere in preparation
- Sesame may be removable or avoidable
- The disclaimer provides meaningful guidance rather than shifting responsibility
- Other menu items without explicit allergen words may be safer by comparison

### Structural Assumption

- A general allergen disclaimer meaningfully clarifies allergen risk at the item level

## Questions I Cannot Definitively Answer at This Point

- Is sesame used as a seed crust, oil, seasoning, or multiple forms?
- How integrated is sesame into the dish (surface-level vs. structural)?
- Is sesame oil used in other components of the dish?
- Would removing the crust meaningfully reduce allergen risk?
- Is cross-contact with sesame likely on shared equipment?
- Does the disclaimer increase clarity, or simply defer responsibility to the diner?
- How would a diner with a severe sesame allergy interpret this description versus a mild allergy?
- What level of safety, if any, is the menu implicitly claiming by pairing explicit allergen naming with a general disclaimer?
