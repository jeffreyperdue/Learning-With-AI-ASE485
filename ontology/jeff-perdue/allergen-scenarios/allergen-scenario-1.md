# Allergen Ambiguity Scenario #1

**A single menu item:** Chicken liver mousse – mushroom, onion, pistachio

Taken directly from [Sotto](https://www.sottocincinnati.com/menus/#dinner) on 2.3.26

A restaurant menu lists an antipasti dish described as chicken liver mousse – mushroom, onion, pistachio. The description includes pistachio as one of several components, but the menu does not otherwise indicate allergens, preparation methods, or cross-contact risks.

## Entities Involved

### Core Food-Related Entities

- **Menu Item**
  - Chicken liver mousse

- **Ingredient**
  - Chicken liver
  - Mushroom
  - Onion
  - Pistachio

- **Allergen**
  - Tree nut (pistachio)

### Representation and Communication Entities

- **Menu Description**
  - Short ingredient-style listing used to convey the dish

- **Allergen Disclosure (implicit)**
  - The presence of "pistachio" as text, without formal allergen labeling

### Contextual and Environmental Entities

- **Preparation Method**
  - How pistachio is used (whole, crumbled, blended, garnish, oil, cross-used equipment)

- **Kitchen Environment**
  - Shared equipment, surfaces, storage, and handling practices

- **Restaurant**
  - Party responsible for preparation and communication

- **Consumer**
  - A diner, potentially with a tree nut allergy

- **Allergic Condition**
  - Sensitivity ranging from mild to severe tree nut allergy

> **Note:** Pistachio in this context exists simultaneously as an ingredient, an allergen, a communication signal, and a risk factor.

## Assumptions Being Made

### By the Restaurant

- Customers with nut allergies may recognize and avoid the dish
- The term "pistachio" clearly implies tree nut allergen risk
- The dish does not require a disclaimer because the allergen is explicit (noting that this menu contains no disclaimers at all)

### By the Consumer

- Pistachio is intentionally and accurately listed
- Pistachio is the only nut-related risk in the dish
- Pistachio may be present in a visible or removable form
- Other dishes without listed nut terms may be safer by comparison
- The absence of allergen icons, warnings, or disclaimers implies lower overall risk

### Structural Assumption

- Mentioning an allergenic ingredient is equivalent to communicating allergen risk

## Questions I Cannot Definitively Answer

- Is pistachio a garnish, a blended component, or infused into the mousse?
- How many components of the dish involve pistachio (e.g., garnish and blended into the mousse)?
- Are other tree nuts used in the kitchen or on nearby dishes?
- Is cross-contact with tree nuts possible via shared equipment?
- Would removing pistachio meaningfully reduce allergen risk?
- Is the restaurant intentionally signaling allergen presence, or simply listing flavor components? (My strong hunch is the latter.)
- How would a diner with a severe tree nut allergy interpret this description versus a mild allergy?
- What level of safety, if any, is the menu implicitly claiming by listing pistachio this way?
