# Allergen Ambiguity Scenario #2

**A single menu item:** Pimientos de Shishito – blistered shishito peppers, Maldon sea salt

Taken directly from [Sotto](https://www.sottocincinnati.com/menus/#dinner) on 2.3.26

A menu lists a small plate of blistered shishito peppers seasoned with sea salt. No allergens are mentioned, and the description suggests a simple preparation focused on vegetables and seasoning.

## Entities Involved

### Core Food-Related Entities

- **Menu Item**
  - Pimientos de shishito

- **Ingredient**
  - Shishito peppers
  - Maldon sea salt

### Hidden but Relevant Entities

- **Cooking Medium**
  - Oil or fat used for blistering (unspecified)

- **Preparation Surface**
  - Pan, grill, flattop, etc.

- **Kitchen Environment**
  - Shared equipment used for other dishes

- **Allergen**
  - Not explicitly listed, but potentially introduced indirectly

- **Consumer**
  - A diner seeking a low- or no-risk option

- **Allergic Condition**
  - Could include any number of food allergies

## Assumptions Being Made

### By the Restaurant

- The simplicity of the dish communicates safety
- Oil choice is not relevant enough to mention
- Shared equipment does not need to be disclosed
- Absence of allergenic ingredients equals low allergen concern

### By the Consumer

- The peppers are cooked in a neutral oil
- No butter, nut oil, or animal fat is used
- The dish is isolated from allergen-heavy preparations
- If there were allergen risks, they would be mentioned

### Structural Assumption

- No mention of an allergenic ingredient is equivalent to communicating lower allergen risk

## Questions I Cannot Definitively Answer

- What oil or fat is used to blister the peppers?
- Is butter ever used in this preparation?
- Is the cooking surface shared with shellfish, nuts, or breaded items?
- Could nut oils (e.g., almond, hazelnut) be used elsewhere on the preparation or cooking line?
- Is cross-contact risk increased during service rush?
- Is this dish considered "safe" by the kitchen, or just "simple"?
- Is the menu intentionally implying safety, or simply omitting detail?
