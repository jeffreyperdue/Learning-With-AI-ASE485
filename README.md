# Learning With AI — Repository Overview

## Purpose of This Repository

The primary purpose is to document individual and shared learning efforts where AI is used as a **learning partner** to explore unfamiliar ideas, ask better questions, and reflect on understanding.

Rather than serving as a finished product or technical implementation, this repository is organized to make learning activities easy to find, review, and understand.

## Repository Structure (How to Navigate)

At the highest level, this repository is organized around **shared learning topics** and **individual learning topics**.



This structure is intentional and reflects how learning is shared and separated in this project.

---

## Shared Learning Topic: Ontology

The `ontology/` folder contains a **shared learning topic** that both Anna and Jeff are contributing to.

- This topic focuses on **exploring ontology design using food allergens as a learning domain**
- Each contributor has their **own subfolder** within `ontology/`
- Individual work, notes, reflections, and examples live inside those subfolders
- A dedicated `ontology/README.md` explains the shared topic and learning goals in more detail

This setup allows both contributors to explore the *same idea* while keeping their learning paths and reflections clearly separated.

---

## Individual Learning Topics

In addition to the shared topic, each contributor has their own **individual Learning With AI topic**, located at the top level of the repository:

- `anna-dinius-individual/`
- `jeff-perdue-individual/`

Each of these folders contains:
- A `README.md` explaining the individual learning focus
- Supporting notes or artifacts related only to that person’s exploration

These topics are independent and do not overlap unless explicitly stated.

---

## Why This Structure Was Chosen

This structure was designed to:

- Make it easy to distinguish **shared learning** from **individual learning**
- Keep contributions clearly attributed without mixing files
- Allow readers to quickly locate:
  - A shared topic
  - A specific contributor
  - An individual learning effort
- Support evaluation, reflection, and review without requiring technical background

The goal is clarity and accessibility rather than complexity.

---

## How to Use This Repository

If you are reviewing this repository:

- Start with this README to understand the layout
- Visit the `ontology/README.md` for the shared learning topic
- Navigate into individual folders to see each contributor’s work
- Read individual READMEs for context before reviewing any notes or artifacts

No prior technical knowledge is required to follow the structure.

## Summary

This repository organizes **Learning With AI** work into shared and individual spaces, making learning goals, ownership, and navigation explicit. It is intentionally minimal, reflective, and structured to support exploration rather than delivery.
